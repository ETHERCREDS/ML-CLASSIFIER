# Machine Learning Model for Code Review

## Overview

Model Details
Random Forest Classifier
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes for classification. Here's how it works:

Random Sampling: The algorithm builds multiple decision trees by randomly selecting subsets of the training data.

Decision Trees: Each tree is trained independently on its subset of data.

Voting: The final prediction is determined by aggregating the predictions of all trees (voting for classification tasks).

Advantages
Reduced Overfitting: The ensemble of trees reduces the risk of overfitting.
High Accuracy: Random Forest tends to provide accurate predictions.
Feature Importance: It can highlight important features contributing to predictions.
Robust to Outliers: It is less sensitive to outliers compared to individual decision trees.


## Getting Started

To run the machine learning model, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

- Python (3.6 or higher)
- Pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ml-code-review.git
   cd ml-code-review
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install scikit-learn pandas
Usage
Run the provided Python script to train the Random Forest Classifier and obtain predictions:

bash
Copy code
python ml_model.py
This script uses a dummy dataset for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, you would replace this dataset with your project's actual data.
